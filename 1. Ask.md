# Business Task 

## About Firm 
Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use bikes to commute to work each day.

## Stakeholders
- Lily Moreno (Director of Marketing)
- Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team

## Problem trying to Solve
Lily Moreno and her team are curious about how people who use the bikes every day (annual members) are different from those who use them occasionally (casual riders). They want to find out what makes these two groups use Cyclistic bikes in different ways. By understanding these differences, they can make the service better and encourage more people to become yearly members.
